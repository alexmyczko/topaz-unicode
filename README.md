Topaz Unicode
=============

Notes:

 - The ß glyph was designed to be ambiguous between
   U+00DF ß LATIN SMALL LETTER SHARP S and
   U+03B2 β GREEK SMALL LETTER BETA,
   but since Unicode supports each glyph separately
   I disambiguated them
 - I've added all the glyphs in the WGL4 set
 - I've also added a bunch of box drawing characters,
   and Symbols for Legacy Computing
